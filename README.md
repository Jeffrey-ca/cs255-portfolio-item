The drivepass project was about designing the system for aiding students in passing driving tests. This would include an online system that has up-to-date test quizes, teacher feedback, and study material designed to increase the passing rate of student drivers. I think I did the whole project fairly well. I liked making the UML diagrams but I think I definetly need to work on how they look because they often don't look the best. When approaching and designing a system based around the transcript of the users needs it's important to understand what they want and ask questions to get a better understanding. While asking questions I would frame the questions to gain an understanding of how the the system should be designed and built. While approaching designing software systems in the future I would try to gain a understanding of the whole picture and how each element of the system should interact with other parts. Gaining a deeper understanding should help make the designing process go quicker and work better.
